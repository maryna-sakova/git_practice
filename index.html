        <h3>About me</h3>
        <div class="p_about">
            <p>Hello there! I'm Maryna Sakova (my nickname is Mi√ºscha), a passionate full stack developer with a love for turning ideas into reality through code. With a background in both front-end and back-end development, I thrive on creating seamless, user-friendly websites and applications that not only look great but also function flawlessly.</p>
            <p>My journey in the world of programming started some time ago. Since then, I've honed my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Git; GitGub, and various frameworks to build responsive web applications. I enjoy working on both the server side and client side, using technologies like Node.js, React, and Express to bring projects to life.</p>
            <p>Collaboration is key in my work ethic, and I delight in working with multidisciplinary teams to bring diverse ideas to the table. I believe in constant learning and staying updated with the latest trends in technology to deliver the best solutions to clients.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me knitting, playing Animals Crossing or playing with my the coolest son in the world Leonardo. I believe in a well-rounded approach to life, drawing inspiration from various sources to fuel my creativity in development.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out for any collaboration opportunities or simply a chat about all things tech. Let's create something amazing together!</p>
